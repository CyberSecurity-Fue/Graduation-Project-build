🛡️ CTI-BlockchainAi: A Decentralized Cyber Threat Intelligence Platform
Turning Paranoia into Power, Anonymously.

Welcome to the official repository for our graduation project: "Crowdsourced Cyber Threat Intelligence with Blockchain."

In the shadowy world of cyber threats, organizations fight their battles in silence. Fear, mistrust, and the risk of exposure prevent the very collaboration that could make us all safer. We're building a new paradigm—a decentralized sanctuary where threat intelligence can be shared freely, verified collectively, and trusted inherently.

🎯 Our Mission: The "What"
To transform cyber defense from a reactive, isolated struggle into a proactive, united front. We are creating a blockchain-based platform that allows cybersecurity professionals and organizations to:

Share Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) securely and anonymously.

Verify the authenticity of threat data without a central authority.

Ensure data integrity, transparency, and immutability.

Empower defenses with AI-driven insights into emerging threats.

🗺️ The Journey: Levels to Completion (The "How")
Think of our project as building a secure, intelligent city from the ground up. Here are the districts we need to construct:

Level 1: The Foundation - Blockchain Core & Smart Contracts 🏗️
Goal: Establish the immutable, trustless backbone of our platform.

Deliverables:

A robust Smart Contract (in Solidity) deployed on an Ethereum testnet (e.g., Sepolia).

Functions to submit IoC hashes, query data, and manage permissions.

Ensure data provenance and tamper-proof records.

What we need to study: Solidity, Ethereum development, Truffle/Hardhat, Web3.js or Ethers.js.

Level 2: The Gateway - Backend API & Security Layer 🔐
Goal: Build the secure bridge between the user and the blockchain.

Deliverables:

A Node.js + Express.js server.

RESTful API endpoints for user interactions (submit IoC, get feed).

Handle user authentication and cryptographic signing of transactions.

Integrate with the blockchain layer via Web3.

What we need to study: Node.js, Express, REST API principles, cryptography (hashing, digital signatures).

Level 3: The Brain - AI Validation & Analysis Layer 🧠
Goal: Infuse the platform with intelligence to auto-validate and score threats.

Deliverables:

A Python service that ingests submitted IoCs.

Machine Learning models (e.g., for classification) to assess the credibility and threat level of IoCs.

NLP techniques to analyze and categorize threat descriptions.

What we need to study: Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, NLP libraries (NLTK, spaCy), model training/evaluation.

Level 4: The Interface - Frontend DApp 🖥️
Goal: Create an intuitive and powerful user interface for our platform.

Deliverables:

A web application built with React.

Features: User dashboard, IoC submission form, real-time threat intelligence feed, visualization of threat data.

Seamlessly connect to our backend API.

What we need to study: React.js, modern CSS/HTML, state management (e.g., Redux), frontend-backend integration.

Level 5: Data Persistence & Decentralized Storage 💾
Goal: Efficiently store and retrieve large sets of IoC data.

Deliverables:

Integrate MongoDB for storing full IoC metadata.

Explore IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for a more decentralized storage solution.

What we need to study: MongoDB, Mongoose ODM, IPFS concepts and APIs.

Level 6: Integration, Testing & Deployment 🚀
Goal: Bring all the pieces together into a cohesive, working system and launch it.

Deliverables:

End-to-end integration of all layers.

Comprehensive unit and integration tests.

Deployment of the full-stack application.

What we need to study: Docker, CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions), deployment on cloud services (e.g., AWS, Heroku, Vercel).

📚 Our Arsenal: What We Need to Study
To conquer these levels, our team needs to become masters of:

Blockchain & Web3: Solidity, Smart Contract development, Ethereum, Gas optimization.

Backend Engineering: Node.js, Express, API design, security best practices.

Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning: Python, data preprocessing, model training, Scikit-learn, NLP.

Frontend Development: React, JavaScript (ES6+), asynchronous programming, UI/UX design.

Databases: NoSQL with MongoDB, potentially IPFS.

DevOps & Tools: Git/GitHub, Docker, basic cloud deployment.

✨ The Vision
We are not just writing code. We are architecting a more resilient digital future. By the end of this journey, we will have delivered a functional prototype that proves trust can be engineered and collaboration can be secure.

Let's build something that matters.
